#Review of my final project
This has been a crazy project. Honestly I also have no clue on what to add or style this with so I am gonna try my best.

I technically have meet all my "need to have" on my proposal, but I am not satisfied with my project. I worked very hard trying to figure out all of the problems I had, which took up all of my time. I worked for weeks on the local storage which was a major part of my project. I am very impressed with how it has come out. I also love the look at of my project. Yet after spending many days, especially this last couple days trying to come up with a deleting/finished project button, I still was unable to figure that out. I have tried adding glyphicons to the input bars, even creating my own outputs with buttons, but was unsuccessful.

I would say my project is really cool, I just wish I had knew a little bit more so I could have been faster and gotten to more of what I would have liked to see in my project.

#Local Storage Problems
After many weeks of work I finally figured out my best Idea for the local storage saving. I pretty much take whatever the input was typed in, and when saved it JSON.stringify it and makes it in to one long sting. Then reloads the website which will output all the inputs saved in the local storage, using bootstrap. One of my favorite parts is the ability to delete an item in the console and when saving a new item gives it the lowest possible key number. This is done by checking each time an item is saved, using a for loop to check from 0 and up until it finds a space which is null and then gives it that specific number as its key.

#Displaying Items
Now this not not even close what I want it to be. I have worked on this for ever now and this has been the way I came back to just to make it work. I have been attempting to added my own css in with buttons that would delete and finish tasks. But for right now I have just used an bootstrap output that is linked to the html to see it on the webpage.

#Beta Testing
I asked some family and friends to take a quick look at my app and give me some pointers. Everyone was able to figure out how it worked. From everyone I had talked to, they all thought my app was amazing but needed a delete/finished task button. So I tried to work on that but was un able to figure it out. So as of right now you can just delete all.
